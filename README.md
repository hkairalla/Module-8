# Online Shopping Cart - Portfolio Project for CSC500

This repository contains the implementation of an **Online Shopping Cart**, developed as part of the CSC500 course portfolio project. The project is divided into multiple milestones, each building upon the previous to create a fully functional shopping cart application in Python.


## Project Overview

The **Online Shopping Cart** simulates the functionality of an e-commerce platform, enabling users to:
1. Add items to a shopping cart.
2. Remove items from the cart.
3. Modify item quantities.
4. View item descriptions and cart totals.
5. Interact with the shopping cart through a menu-driven interface.

This project showcases object-oriented programming principles in Python, including the use of classes, attributes, methods, and user input handling.
